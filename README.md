Modernizing culinary practices involves the integration of technology and innovative approaches to streamline and enhance the process of preparing dishes. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach to optimize culinary processes through the use of Functional Object-Oriented Network (FOON) and efficient search algorithms. FOON, a structured framework capturing the essence of dish preparation, incorporates functional units, nodes, edges, and task trees. Leveraging Iterative Deepending Search (IDS) and Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) guided by heuristic functions, we extract task trees for various dishes, seeking to improve the efficiency and accuracy of culinary operations. The performance comparison of these algorithms, considering functional units, computational complexity, and memory usage, sheds light on their efficacy in culinary task optimization.
